# Welcome to our Data-4-SDG Research Repository

### How to Navigate

This repository currently contains work from **4** project themes. 
1. Monitoring Global Aid - Focus: Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
2. Criminal Justice in SIDS
3. Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center Dashboard
4. Mapping Tutorial for the United States - Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI)

Each of these project themes has it's own folder in this repository that contains all of the final data and code used for analysis. 
- Project Descriptions, Funders, Students, and Mentors are descriced for each project below



## Theme 1. Monitoring Global Aid - Focus: Small Island Developing States (SIDS)

**Goal of this work**

Subset data from the paper [*Monitoring Global Development Aid with Machine Learning*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00874-z) to visualize more granular descriptions of aid than the 17 SDG’s for Small Island Develping States (SIDS)

- How much aid is each SIDS receiving?:
  
   - For which sectors? (31 total)
  
- For SIDS as a whole, what proportion of the overall aid goes to each of the specific topics? (171 total)

**Results**

Final results are displayed and described in this R Publication: [SIDS-Focused Analysis of the Results from ‘Monitoring global development aid with machine learning](https://rpubs.com/connorflynn/1049427)

**Goal of this Work**

The main goal of this project is to assess the staus of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) on Criminal Justice-Oriented Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's). Throughout our data-collection process, we encountered significant amounts of mising data. This framed
  - Research Question 1: Are SIDS reporting data on Criminal Justice-Oriented Sustainable Development Goals less than Non-SIDS. This can inspire insight into the culture and systems of SIDS playing an important role into the survey response rates.
  - Research Aim 2: - Analyze the Global Organized Crime Index through a SIDS - specific lens and visualize the data in a manner that can be integrated into the UNDP SIDS Data Platform 

### Data 

We accessed the [UNODC Status of Country Data Submissions by Data Collection Campaign Year](https://dataunodc.un.org/content/ms-data-collection-log) to create a dataset based on completion of 5 surveys shown below.
